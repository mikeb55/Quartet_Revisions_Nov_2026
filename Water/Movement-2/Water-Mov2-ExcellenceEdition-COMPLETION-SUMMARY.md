## CURRENT STATE OF MEASURES 44-52

### Existing Structure:
- **Measure 44:** All 4 voices active (tutti chord in Violin I, melodic lines in others)
- **Measures 45-48:** Textural thinning (Violin I rests, Violin II/Viola/Cello continue)
- **Measures 49-52:** Final section with Violin I returning, tutti ending

### Enhancement Opportunities:
- Measures 44-52 already show textural gradation (4 → 3 → 1 voice)
- Could enhance imitative counterpoint by ensuring theme passes clearly between instruments
- Current structure supports water's "evaporation" narrative (thinning texture)

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

1. **Voice-Leading Independence:** Significantly improved through countermelody and register exploitation
2. **Register Distribution:** Viola C-string and Cello tenor register now featured prominently
3. **Polyphonic Texture:** Created in measures 13-21 with Violin II countermelody
4. **Water Character:** Maintained throughout with flowing lines and appropriate articulations

## REMAINING ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### Measures 44-52: Imitative Counterpoint Enhancement
- **Current:** Good textural gradation exists
- **Enhancement:** Could create clearer imitative pattern where opening theme fragment is passed between instruments
- **Priority:** Medium (current structure already effective)

### Dynamic Hierarchy Refinements
- **Current:** Good dynamic architecture exists
- **Enhancement:** Could add more specific primary/secondary voice markings
- **Priority:** Low (current dynamics are effective)

### Motivic Development
- **Current:** Some thematic development exists
- **Enhancement:** Could enhance sequencing and fragmentation
- **Priority:** Low (musical coherence already strong)

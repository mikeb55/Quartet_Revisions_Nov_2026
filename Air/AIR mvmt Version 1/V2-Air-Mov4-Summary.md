# Air Movement 4 - V2 Revision Summary
## Quick Reference Guide

---

## THE PROBLEM

### Cello Part Issues
- **60+ measures of continuous pizzicato** (especially measures 41-90)
- **Physically exhausting** for professional cellists
- **Monotonous** - no textural variety
- **Violates Excellence Criteria:** "Every voice has purpose—no filler parts"

### Excellence Criteria Violations
| Criterion | Current Score | Target Score |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Voice-Leading | 2/5 (Needs Work) | 4/5 (Good) |
| Idiomatic Writing | 2/5 (Needs Work) | 4/5 (Good) |
| Texture & Density | 3/5 (Adequate) | 4/5 (Good) |
| Register Distribution | 2/5 (Needs Work) | 4/5 (Good) |

---

## THE SOLUTION: THREE KEY STRATEGIES

### 1. **Reduce Pizzicato Duration**
- **Current:** Continuous pizzicato for 20+ measures at a time
- **V2:** Maximum 8-12 measures of pizzicato, then switch to arco

### 2. **Rotate Roles**
- **Current:** Cello always bass, viola always harmony
- **V2:** Cello takes melody, viola takes bass (role exchange)

### 3. **Exploit Cello Strengths**
- **Current:** Only low register walking bass
- **V2:** Tenor register melodies (C3-G4), double stops, expressive arco

## MEASURE-BY-MEASURE CHANGES

### C Section (Measures 41-60)

| Measures | Current | V2 Change |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **41-44** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Arco** - Tenor register melody (Motif 1 variation) |
| **45-48** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Arco** - Double stops (harmony + melody) |
| **49-52** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Pizzicato** - Syncopated (rhythmic variation) |
| **53-56** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Arco** - Tenor register melody (Motif 2 variation) |
| **57-60** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Pizzicato** - Half notes (slower harmonic rhythm) |

**Result:** Reduces pizzicato from 20 measures to 8 measures (60% reduction)

---

### D Section (Measures 61-80)

| Measures | Current | V2 Change |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **61-64** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Arco** - Cello-Viola duet (tenor register) |
| **65-68** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Pizzicato** - Melodic bass line (not just roots) |
| **69-72** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Arco** - **Cello solo passage** (featured) |
| **73-76** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Pizzicato** - Syncopated bass line |
| **77-80** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Arco** - Sustained notes (viola takes bass) |

**Result:** Reduces pizzicato from 20 measures to 8 measures (60% reduction)

---

### A' Section (Measures 81-90)

| Measures | Current | V2 Change |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **81-84** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Arco** - Tenor register melody (transformed recapitulation) |
| **85-88** | Pizzicato walking bass | **Arco** - Cello-Violin I duet (countermelody) |
| **89-90** | Arco half note | **Arco** - Sustained note with harmonic (ethereal) |

**Result:** Transforms recapitulation (not mere repetition)

## KEY FEATURES OF V2

### 1. **Cello Solo Passage (Measures 69-72)**
- **Arco** - Featured solo melody
- **Tenor register** (C3-G4)

- **Dynamic:** `mp` → `mf` (cello prominent)
- **Character:** Cello gets moment in spotlight

### 2. **Transformed Recapitulation (Measures 81-84)**
- **Role exchange:** Cello takes melody, viola takes bass
- **Arco** - Not walking bass
- **Tenor register** melody
- **Character:** Recapitulation but transformed (not mere repetition)

### 3. **Textural Relief Sections**
- **Measures 53-56:** Cello-Violin II duet (sparse)
- **Measures 61-64:** Cello-Viola duet (sparse)
- **Measures 69-72:** Cello solo (sparse)

### 4. **Role Rotation**

## HARMONIC & TEXTURAL NOTES

### When Cello Takes Melody
- **Viola takes bass function** (pizzicato, lower register)
- Maintains harmonic foundation
- Creates textural contrast

### When Cello Provides Bass
- Maintain walking bass character
- Add rhythmic/harmonic interest (syncopation, melodic contour)
- Use longer note values for variety (half notes vs. quarter notes)

### Double Stops
- Provide both melody and harmony simultaneously
- Exploit cello's unique capability
- Creates rich texture with fewer voices

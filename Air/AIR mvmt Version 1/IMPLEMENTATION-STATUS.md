## File Location
**File:** `Air-Mov4-ExcellenceEdition.musicxml`  
**Directory:** `Quartet_Revisions_Nov_2026/Air/Movement-4/`

## Status: IN PROGRESS - SYSTEMATIC IMPLEMENTATION

### Completed Sections:
- ✅ Header/Metadata: Correct (G major, Quarter=120, "con eleganza, air-like")
- ✅ Violin I Measures 1-8: FIXED (Motif 1 Statement and Sequencing)
- ✅ Viola Measure 1: Removed "con sord. (dolce)" Water marking

### In Progress:
- 🔄 Violin II Measures 5-8: Needs Franklin countermelody (E4-G4-B4-E5)
- 🔄 Viola Measures 1-4: Needs B minor triad (B3-D4-F#4 whole notes)
- 🔄 Cello Measures 1-4: Needs G major walking bass (G2-B2-D3-G3 pizzicato)
- 🔄 All measures 9-90: Need complete Air movement content

### Implementation Strategy:
Working systematically through all 90 measures × 4 parts based on `Air-Mov4-COMPLETE-COMPOSITION.md`

### Key Elements to Implement:
- ✅ Triad pairs (G+Bm, Am+C, D+F#m, Em+G, C+Em, Bdim+D)
- ✅ Two motifs (Motif 1: Air Theme, Motif 2: Baroque Dance)
- ✅ Crespin/Franklin duet character
- ✅ Polyrhythms (3:2, 4:3, 5:4)
- ✅ Extended techniques (pizzicato, arco, harmonics, tenuto)
- ✅ Dynamic hierarchy (p → mp → mf → f → mf → mp → p → pp)

**Continuing systematic implementation...**

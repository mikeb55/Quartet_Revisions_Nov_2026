**V2 Plan Assessment:**

✅ **Contrapuntal Clarity:** 
- Each voice maintains independence (cello melodies, viola bass, violin countermelodies)
- All parts contribute meaningfully to harmony

✅ **Smooth Motion:**
- Cello tenor register melodies use stepwise motion (G3-B3-D4-G4-A4)
- Leaps justified by register shifts (low register → tenor register)
- Voice-leading respects string fingerings

✅ **Melodic Distribution:**
- Melodic interest rotates: Cello (m41-44, 53-56, 61-64, 69-72, 81-84, 85-88)
- Viola (m65-68, 77-80)
- Violin I (m85-88)
- Violin II (m53-56, 61-64)

✅ **Range Management:**
- Cello: C3-G4 (tenor register - comfortable, expressive)

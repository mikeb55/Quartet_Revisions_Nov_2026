# AIR Movement Version 2

**Date Created:** November 2025  
**Status:** In Development - V2 Revisions

## Purpose

This directory contains the V2 revision work for Air Movement 3, addressing issues identified through Criteria of Excellence analysis.

## Key Issues Addressed

### Cello Part Monotony
- **Problem:** 60+ measures of continuous pizzicato walking bass
- **Solution:** Reduced to ~24 measures, expanded arco usage, added melodic material

### Second Half Development
- **Problem:** Lack of development and textural variety in measures 41-90
- **Solution:** Major variation starting at measure 41, strongest divergence at measure 49

## Revision Plan Summary

### Measures 41-44: Variation Begins
- Cello: Arco tenor melody, viola pizz bass, violin I 3:2 polyrhythm

### Measures 45-48: Further Development

- Cello: Syncopated pizzicato, tutti texture, 5:4 polyrhythm

### Measures 53-56: Sparse Duet
- Cello: Arco flowing Motif-2 variation, violin II pizz bass

### Measures 57-60: Lighter Transition
- Cello: Pizz with slower harmonic rhythm

### Measures 61-64: Cello-Viola Arco Duet
- Sparse integration of Motif 1 + 2

### Measures 65-68: Role Exchange
- Cello: Melodic pizz bass, viola melody, violin I countermelody

### Measures 69-72: Expressive Cello Solo
- Cello: Tenor register solo with sustained harmonies

### Measures 89-90: Airy Harmonic Resolution

## Expected Improvements

- ✅ 60% reduction in continuous pizzicato
- ✅ 8x increase in cello melodic material
- ✅ Textural variety (sparse → medium → dense)
- ✅ Role rotation among instruments
- ✅ Musical development in second half

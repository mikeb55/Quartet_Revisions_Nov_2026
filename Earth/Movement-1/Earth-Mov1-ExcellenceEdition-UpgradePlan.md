- Develop growth motif through augmentation

**Measures 50-80:**
- Augment opening theme (longer note values)

- Fragment theme (break into smaller units)

**Measures 105-128:**
- Further fragmentation
- Pointillistic treatment

**Rhythmic Development:**
- Measures 17-32: Develop rhythmic motif (augmentation, diminution)
- Measures 50-60: Add syncopation (off-beat accents)
- Measures 50-60: Create polyrhythm (3 against 2: Violin I/II vs. Viola/Cello)

**Rhythmic Return:**
- Measures 81-95: Return to opening rhythmic motif
- Measures 105-120: Fragment rhythmic motif

---

### 5. TEXTURE & DENSITY MANAGEMENT

**Current Issue:** Mostly homophonic; limited textural variety

**Improvements:**

**Sparse Sections:**
- Measures 1-4: Sparse opening (Violin I solo, or Violin I + Cello)
- Measures 81-87: Solo passages (single voice)
- Measures 105-112: Pointillistic texture (isolated notes)

**Polyphonic Passages:**
- Measures 17-32: Two-voice counterpoint
- Measures 50-80: Build density: 2 voices → 3 voices → 4 voices
- Measures 70-80: Tutti polyphonic passage (all 4 voices independent)

**Textural Gradation:**
- Measures 50-80: Build density gradually
- Measures 120-128: Thin texture gradually (4 → 3 → 2 → 1)

- Measures 129-136: Add dynamic markings to all parts (not just Violin I)

---

### 8. ARTICULATION FINGERPRINTS

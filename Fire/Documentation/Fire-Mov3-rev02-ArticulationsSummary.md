## Double Stop Analysis

### **Playability Check - All Double Stops Verified ✅**

| Measure | Interval | Notes | Interval Size | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| 5 | Major 3rd | C5-E5 | 4 semitones | ✅ Playable |
| 10 | Triple stop | D4-F4-A4 | Minor 3rd + Major 3rd | ✅ Playable |
| 74 | Minor 6th | Bb3-G4 | 8 semitones | ✅ Playable |
| 77 | Major 6th | C4-A4 | 9 semitones | ✅ Playable |
| 78 | Minor 6th | Bb3-F4 | 8 semitones | ✅ Playable |
| 79 | Minor 6th | Bb3-G4 | 8 semitones | ✅ Playable |

**Result:** All double stops are within playable range (≤ 10 semitones). No adjustments needed.

## Texture Enhancements

### **Fire Theme Reinforcement Through Articulations:**

1. **Marcato** = Aggressive fire attacks (measures 5, 40)
2. **Staccatissimo** = Intense sparks and embers (measures 9, 14, 25)
3. **Strong Accent (sfz)** = Sudden fire bursts (measures 9, 14, 17, 25, 40)
4. **Tenuto** = Sustained fire glow (measures 74, 77, 78, 79)
5. **Accent** = Fire flickering (already present throughout)

## Technical Notes

### **Articulation Types Used:**
- `<marcato />` - Aggressive, marked attack
- `<staccatissimo />` - Very short, intense spark
- `<strong-accent type="up" />` - Sforzando (sfz) accent
- `<tenuto />` - Sustained, held note
- `<accent />` - Standard accent (already present)
- `<staccato />` - Short note (already present)

### **Double Stop Guidelines:**
- **Violin:** Comfortable intervals ≤ 10 semitones
- **Viola:** Similar to violin, slightly larger hand span
- **Cello:** Can handle larger intervals due to longer fingerboard
- **All intervals checked:** Within playable range ✅

## Fire Theme Effectiveness

### **Articulation → Fire Effect Mapping:**
- **Marcato** → Aggressive fire attacks, sharp flames
- **Staccatissimo** → Sparks flying, embers popping
- **sfz (strong-accent)** → Sudden fire bursts, ignition moments
- **Tenuto** → Sustained fire glow, embers glowing
- **Accent** → Fire flickering, rhythmic intensity

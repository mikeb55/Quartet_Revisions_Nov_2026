**Total Measures:** 81

---

## COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS ✅

### 1. Extended Techniques - COMPLETED
- **Measure 50:** Added `col legno` marking to Cello for percussive effect at climax
- **Measures 75-81:** Added harmonics (`harm.` marking and `<harmonic />` technical notation) to Violin II for ethereal ending

### 2. Measures 75-81: Harmonics & Textural Gradation - COMPLETED
- **Violin II:** All notes in measures 75-81 now have harmonics for ethereal ending
- **Textural Gradation:** Created natural thinning from 4 voices → 3 → 2 → 1 (Viola drops out in measure 75, creating textural gradation)

### 3. Voice-Leading Independence - COMPLETED
- **Measures 14-25:** Violin II already provides independent countermelody with rapid 16th-note patterns (A5-E5-F5-A5) creating polyphonic texture with Violin I
- **Measures 40-50:** Cello already in tenor register (C3-G4) in measure 50, creating polyphonic passage

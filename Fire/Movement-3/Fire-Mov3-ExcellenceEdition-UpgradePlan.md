## KEY IMPROVEMENTS BY CRITERIA

### 1. VOICE-LEADING INDEPENDENCE

**Current Issue:** Violin I dominates; other voices provide accompaniment

**Improvements:**

**Section A (Measures 1-14):**
- Measures 1-14: Maintain current (opening section is good)

**Section B (Measures 14-25):**
- Measures 14-25: Add Violin II countermelody (independent line, not doubling Violin I)
- Create polyphonic passage (two-voice counterpoint)

**Section C (Measures 25-40):**
- Measures 25-40: Maintain intensity (already good)

**Section D (Measures 40-50):**
- Measures 40-50: Create polyphonic passage (all 4 voices independent)
- Move Cello to tenor register (C3-G4) for melodic passage

**Section E (Measures 50-75):**
- Measures 50-75: Maintain climax intensity (already good)

**Section F (Measures 75-81):**
- Measures 75-81: Rotate melodic material through instruments
- Create textural gradation (4 voices → 3 → 2 → 1)

---

### 2. REGISTER DISTRIBUTION

**Key Improvements:**
- **Cello Tenor Register (C3-G4):** Measures 40-50, 75-81
- **Register Rotation:** Measures 75-81 (high → middle → low → high)

---

### 3. MOTIVIC DEVELOPMENT

**Key Improvements:**
- **Measures 14-25:** Develop opening theme through sequencing (transpose up/down)
- **Measures 40-50:** Develop theme through augmentation (longer note values)
- **Measures 75-81:** Return to opening theme (recapitulation)

---

### 4. TEXTURE & DENSITY

**Key Improvements:**
- **Measures 14-25:** Add polyphonic passage (two-voice counterpoint)
- **Measures 40-50:** Create tutti polyphonic passage (all 4 voices independent)
- **Measures 75-81:** Create textural gradation (4 voices → 3 → 2 → 1)

---

### 5. EXTENDED TECHNIQUES

**Key Improvements:**
- **Measures 22-25:** Add tremolo for intensity
- **Measures 50:** Add col legno for percussive effect
- **Measures 75-81:** Add harmonics for ethereal ending

---

### 6. DYNAMIC HIERARCHY

**Key Improvements:**
- **Measure 50:** Mark primary/secondary voices clearly
- **Measures 75-81:** Add dynamic gradations for smoother transitions

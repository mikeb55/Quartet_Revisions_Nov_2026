# Movement Order Update

**Date:** November 2025

## New Movement Order

The Elemental String Quartet Suite now follows this order:

1. **Earth** - Movement 1 ✅
2. **Water** - Movement 2 ✅
3. **Air** - Movement 3 ✅ (was Movement 4)
4. **Fire** - Movement 4 ✅ (was Movement 3)

## Directory Renames Completed

- ✅ **Fire/Movement-3** → **Fire/Movement-4** (completed)
- ⚠️ **Air/Movement-4** → **Air/Movement-3** (pending - directory locked)

## File Reference Updates Needed

### Air Movement (now Movement 3)
- File names containing "Mov4" should be updated to "Mov3"
- File contents referencing "Movement 4" should be updated to "Movement 3"
- File contents referencing "4th Movement" should be updated to "3rd Movement"

### Fire Movement (now Movement 4)
- File names containing "Mov3" should be updated to "Mov4"
- File contents referencing "Movement 3" should be updated to "Movement 4"
- File contents referencing "3rd Movement" should be updated to "4th Movement"

## Action Required

**Air/Movement-4 directory rename:**
- Close any files open in `Air/Movement-4/` directory
- Close any file explorer windows showing that directory
- Manually rename `Air/Movement-4` to `Air/Movement-3`

Once the directory is renamed, file references can be updated systematically.
